    <h1>Detailed Description of Global Average Temperature Anomaly Graph</h1>
    <p>This graph shows the global average temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020. The y-axis represents temperature anomalies in degrees Celsius, ranging from -0.5°C to +1.0°C. The x-axis shows the years from 1880 through 2020. Each data point on the graph represents the annual global temperature anomaly measured as the deviation from the 20th-century average.</p>
    <p>The graph features gray circles that mark each year's temperature anomaly, connected by a black line that shows the trend over time. From 1880 to around 1910, there is a slight fluctuation around the zero line. A gradual increase starts from around 1920, with more significant rises from the 1980s onwards. By 2020, the temperature anomaly reaches nearly 1.0°C, indicating a clear upward trend in global temperatures.</p>
    <p>This increase in temperature is significant as it highlights global warming and suggests an accelerating trend in recent decades.</p>
